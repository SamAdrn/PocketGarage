## About this project

Pocket Garage is an innovative automobile data retrieval application that provides users with quick and detailed information about various vehicles. Now, you can easily access comprehensive vehicle information, including specifications such as body classification, fuel type, drivetrain details, engine specifications, and more. With Pocket Garage, you can easily streamline your car research process and make informed decisions.

## How to Use

Pocket Garage makes it really easy to look up the car of your choice. The search model screen provides you with four different pickers that are dependent on one another. They allow you to minimize your search results all the way down to a specific make, model, year, and trim. Not sure about the year or the trim? Leave them blank, and you will be able to choose from all the existing models that have been released up until 2022.

## Inspiration

Cars are complex machines, and there is a vast amount of information to cover for each specific car. While I wish to provide more comprehensive details that would please car nerds, enhance the visual experience by incorporating images of cars from various angles, and many more exciting ideas for the app, there are limitations in accessing databases that are affordable and reliable. As a student, I work on these projects during my free time with limited resources. Nevertheless, I am continuously learning and exploring new possibilities. Future plans include implementing features that allow users to bookmark their favorite cars and introducing a captivating "Car of the Day" section. There is still much to discover and achieve in my journey as a Software Engineer.
